# Human-Interface Guidelines
From Apple's HIG, I used the "lists and tables" page to see how I should design my information views. 
After reading "prefer displaying text in a list or table", I changed my customDataField component to have a shadow and background color to appear more like a list than just text on a screen. 
After looking into Apple's color recommendations, I changed the color of my index buttons to white to match the list items of the other screens for consistency. 
HIG recommends to make sure that scrollable layouts extend to the bottom of the screen even if the content doesn't (in Layout/Best Practices). Because of this I have made set the flexGrow to 1 for the character/ship and allCharacters/allShips screens so it expands to take the whole view.
